I am planning a project to create a Trade Lens - an AI powered stock assistant Flask server with Python. I need your help with the high level direction and initial tasks. First, use the Brave API to search for what use cases we can implement with stock transactions and learn more about them. Then, create a PLANNING.md and TASK.md file.

PLANNING.md – high level direction, scope, tech, etc.
TASK.md – initial tasks to knock out for the project
